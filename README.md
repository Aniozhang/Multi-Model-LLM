# Multi-Model-LLM

This project from Donato Capitella mainly focus on:
1. The architecture and training of multi-modal LLMs.
2. explore Vision Transformers and how they are trained with contrastive learning (OpenAI's CLIP and Google's SigLIP).
3. look into Googleâ€™s open-weight PaliGemma, analysing its implementation to see these concepts in action within a real-world multi-modal LLM.
